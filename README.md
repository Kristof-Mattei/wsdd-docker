# wsdd-docker
Docker image for [wsdd.py](https://github.com/christgau/wsdd/)

wsdd implements a Web Service Discovery host daemon. This enables (Samba) hosts, like your local NAS device or Linux server, to be found by Web Service Discovery Clients like Windows.

## Supported environment variables
HOSTNAME: Samba netbios name to report.

WORKGROUP: Workgroup name

DOMAIN: Report being a member of an AD DOMAIN. Disables WORKGROUP if set. 

## Running container
### From command line
```
docker run --net=host -e HOSTNAME=$(hostname) TODO
```

It is important that the container is run with the argument --net=host and that the environment variable HOSTNAME is set to the same value as your Samba netbios name. Samba netbios name defaults to the hostname. 

### From docker compose
A docker-compose.yml file could look like the one below. 
```
    wsdd:
        image: "jonasped/wsdd"
        environment:
            - HOSTNAME=NETBIOS_NAME
        restart: unless-stopped
        network_mode: "host"
```
